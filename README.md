## Introduction
My name is Owen Miller-Fast; I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology in August 2025. Today, I work in a cross-functional team developing software for DEVCOM AvMC's mission. My love for all-things technology began to bloom when I was thirteen years old when I received my first PC. I would break computers and put them back together to just break them again. After some time, I got interested in how applications and games ran, so history repeated itself. I would program things that would end up breaking the computer and spent time trying to fix them; I had to do a lot of reinstallations. I decided to make programming my career path in highschool, using my spare time to learn programming languages and concepts. Embarrassingly, I wanted to learn because I wanted to become a "master hacker." Although that is no longer my ambition (and I never created any malware), I am grateful my misguided ambition set me down this path. 

## Goals
- Obtain a Master's Degree in computer science.
- Create an online community where individual developers can meet, team together, brainstorm, and bring those ideas to life. A community that fosters creativeness, innovation, and cooperation among developers.
- Develop apps that improves the day-to-day life of users.
- Make meaningful contributions to the computer science community.
