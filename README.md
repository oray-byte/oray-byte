## Introduction
My name is Owen Miller-Fast; I am a student at Missouri S&T. I came from a split family in La Plata, MO. Growing up, I did not have access to a personal computer until I was fifteen. When I got my own computer, I became extremely interested in programming and how the computer worked; to this day, my interest still grows.

While I have not had any professional experiences in a work environment, I have had many experience through personal and academic projects. For example, I took a robotics class over the previous summer. In the class, I had to design a miniature elevator, create a flow diagram, write the script in C, and finally implement the script. The script allowed the miniature elevator to detect what level it was at, respond to user input, and raise and lower the carriage.

I am looking to broaden my skills, gain invaluable experience, and work alongside professionals. With an internship or COOP, I believe I can do that.

## Goals
My long-term goal is graduate college, join the professional world as a software developer, and later rejoin the academic world to obtain my master, and PhD if I am ambitious, for cyber security or artifical intelligence. As for my short-term goals, I want to become a chair head for a committee in my fraternity, obtain a internship before graduating, and engage in research.
